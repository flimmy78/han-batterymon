This is firmware written in C for a PIC microcontroller. With the appropriate hardware it allows voltages and currents in a 12 volt battery backup system to be measured and transmitted over an RS-485 network using the HAN protocol.

To compile the firmware, you will need the Microchip MPLABX IDE and the XC8 compiler. The hardware schematic, and Eagle CAD files can be obtained by email request.
